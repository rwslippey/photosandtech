Well, I've been gone for a very long time it would seem. Life happened, as one would say. As I return, I've decided to make more of a schedule and I'm hoping to keep myself in line here and posting as regularly as possible.

While I was gone I didn't miss out of on the news that [triggertrap is gone](https://medium.com/triggertrap-playbook/triggertrap-going-out-of-business-faq-988112eebfef#.9iy6r5iua) Well, this SUCKS. I really can't think of anything else to say...

Quite honestly I've been thinking of doing a post of Triggertrap here for a while. If you don't know, Triggertrap is a combination of a special cable and an app for your phone that allows you to control your DSLR camera in a bunch of different ways. My first introduction with Triggertrap was when I purchased my 5d classic a few years ago. I purchased the 5d as a kit and kit included a Triggertrap. At the time I had heard of Triggertrap but hadn't bought one. I thought the idea was interesting.

Fast forward a while and I put the Triggertrap to the test. It was awesome. I could program the app to take long exposure or HDR images exactly how I wanted without an expensive device. It just worked with my phone! I couldn't ask for more.

Unfortunatly, I guess all good things must come to an end. Triggertrap announced that they will be going out of business. In a recent article posted to the companyâ€™s website, they cited trouble and the ultimate failure of a kickstarter for their new Triggertrap ada... which looks interesting in and of itself.

It looks like Triggertrap will be selling off inventory, or what is left of it, and plans to be shut down by the end of February 2017. They do say that their apps should work and will remain on the app store but any future updates may break the app. The letter also noted the possibility of an open source takeover, but said it is difficult to accomplish and no one suitable has been found yet.

I really like what Triggertrap had done. They took something a whole lot of us have always complained about, the lack of control, and made it easy. I've always been pestered by the limited abilities of my camera, which can only do 3 brackets??? Come on... Triggertrap solved that problem for me, in a simple and easy to use product.

I look forward to seeing if someone, anyone, will take over the code!
