### The Problem, E-TTL Vs Mirror
Just after Christmas I shot a wedding for my wife's friend from grade school. Her parents had been married 30 years! Yes, 30 years, congrats! So 30 years of marriage and they decided to do it again, again congratulations.

The original plan was for us to provide our photo booth for the reception and that was it, but after talking to my wife's friend on the phone, I thought it'd be a great idea to offer to shoot the wedding. In this case it was a no-brainer.

We arrived with plenty of time to spare. I setup the photo booth and gave my wife the reins of the booth. She ensured everything was working and would man the booth for the night while I was shooting the reception. After getting setup, I set out to get the detail shots while we waited on the bride and groom.

As I walked through the venue I was greeted by a complete wall of mirrors. My first thought was to keep myself and my camera out of the pictures. Something I didn't think about was a mirror's effect on E-TTL flash!

If you're not familiar with how E-TTL works or what it is, let me explain. E-TTL is Electronic-Through The Lens metering. It automatically controls the flash output based on a metering system that works through the lens. I don't often manually set my flash power with on camera flash, so E-TTL is my norm for events.
### How E-TTL Works
E-TTL generally works by firing a low power burst milliseconds before the actual photo is taken and measuring the light that comes through the lens. It then adjusts its power accordingly to expose the photo properly. I generally use E-TTL in conjunction with manual exposure modes on the camera.

So back to the mirrors. It's obvious that if the camera sees the light being reflected back from the mirror directly into the lens it's going to throw the exposure. This is what happened to me when I started shooting the first dance. Shooting into the mirror, while still keeping myself out of the shot, my exposures were coming up dark, REALLY dark! For a few seconds I couldn't figure out what was going on. Eventually I figured it out though.
### The solution
So what's the solution. Well there might be a few. The obvious answer is: don't aim towards the mirrors, but with a room full of them it's kind of hard not to. Another option is to go to manual flash, but this can be tricky in a wedding or event situation. The easiest method I can recommend for manual flash is to use the aperture to control flash output quickly. Just use the dial to adjust as needed. Keep in mind you will be changing the ambient light when you change your aperture though. Finally, another method and my chosen method was to limit the flash's view of the mirror as much as possible. I either placed people between the flash and the mirror, bounced off the wall, or faced the opposite direction. It's not a totally complicated issue, just something I've never seen talked about much before, so I figured I would share.
