In recent years photography has taken a turn. Previously, photographers started in film and then moved into digital
with the digital photography revolution. Now days photographers, including myself, started directly in digital
without any experience in film. This fact lowers the entry price, and the learning curve of photography, but maybe at a price. Film taught patience and required a great deal of understanding. Patience was required during the entire process, from capture, to developing. In an "I want it now" world, does film still have a place? I think so.

Why shoot film in 2017?
===

I've always found film to be fascinating. You take this special paper essentially expose it to light, then dunk it in a bunch of chemicals and you've got an image! It's not only fascinating, it's amazing. Today, we have high end DSLRs that can take photos up to 12 million ISO but I still find film interesting, which is why I decided to give it a go.

Another reason I've decided to try film is as an educational tool. While we utilize very different equipment today for photography, The basic concepts of shutter speed, aperture, and ISO are still the same. As is the effects of depth of field and composition. So in short, slowing down, and taking it frame by frame with a much slower technology, I feel might be beneficial.

The Camera
===

The camera is my dad's old Pentax MV with a 50mm f 1.2 lens. My main interest is 4x5 film, however, funds for a decent 4x5 camera are not yet available, so in the mean time I've decided to learn with this camera, the techniques to capture and develop film. Hopefully, one day I'll be able to afford that nice 4x5 camera and take some trips for some awesome landscapes.

Getting started
===

The first thing you need to do when starting with film is obviously pick your film. Not being an expert in film, I'll refrain from further details. You will find google to be helpful here though. Currently, I've picked up a few rolls of [Ilford HP5 Plus 400 ISO film](http://amzn.to/2yrXqc3){:target="_blank"} Similar to digital 400 ISO indicates how sensitive to light the film is. Unlike digital, you can't change this on the fly. I thought 400 would be a good middle ground, but I've noticed, without significant light in my apartment (think big open window) it is a little slow for indoors. Honestly, I should have known better. Otherwise the Ilford HP5 Plus film has been great. I successfully developed this film on the first go without too many issues.

Loading the camera
===

A novel idea for us digital photographers. I have to load my camera? No not with a CF or SD card, with the film! It's a simple process but as you'll see, can be messed up. The process involves taking your new roll of film, opening the back of the camera. In the left side you'll generally insert the film canister then lay the film over the shutter and to the right of the camera. Here is where I messed up. In my hurry to get to shooting, I failed to make sure the film was completely in the sprockets on the right side and in the roller for the "winder". I also missed that the wheel on the top left of the camera didn't turn as I ratcheted the film winder. So what happened? I took about 40 photos before I realized something was wrong because the film roll hadn't ran out. I took literally 40 images over the same frame. Double exposure anybody?

Taking the shots
===

I find film slows you down a bit, and that IS a good thing. Slower more methodical shots are the result, instead of our digital spraying and praying. I take the time to compose the shot, slowly work out the focus, did I mention my lens is manual focus? My camera is also a semi-auto version. I can control the manual apertures and the camera then works out the exposure. Inside the viewfinder I see either a red, yellow, or green light indicating the exposure is proper. No meter though, so you have to figure out if it's too high or low on your own.

Getting ready to develop
===

Finally here comes the fun part. So you've shot your 36 frames (some are 24). First thing we'll do is rewind that film, but don't forget to click the release on the bottom of the camera or as I did you might tear the film when you try to rewind it. While we're at it, keep in mind if anything happens to the film inside the camera, a changing bag is a great thing to have. In my case, when I didn't completely load the film and when I tore the film by forgetting to push the release button, I put the camera in the changing bag, which is completely light tight, and was able to fix the problem, more or less. In the case of the torn film, I was able to roll the film off the camera's inside and roll it on my developing tank reel.

So, push the button, wind the film onto the canister, pop the back open and get ready to develop.

Development
===

Truthfully, you can stop right there and send the canister off to get developed at a lab, by why not do it yourself?
Trust me it's fun.

Supplies and equipment
====

* [Changing Bag](http://amzn.to/2zzBE9Y){:target="_blank"}
* [Developing Tank](http://amzn.to/2hswqGk){:target="_blank"} I originally bought a single 35mm tank but this tank supports either 2 35mm rolls or 1 120mm roll and includes the reels so it might be useful for other cameras and films.
* [Kodak D-76 Developer](http://amzn.to/2ytak9E){:target="_blank"}
* [Stop Bath](http://amzn.to/2hscdQU){:target="_blank"} A stop bath isn't strictly necessary. You could just flush the film with water but I use this stop bath.
* [Fixer](http://amzn.to/2i5ESbz){:target="_blank"}
* [Chemical storage container](http://amzn.to/2ySHyDX){:target="_blank"} You'll need just 1
* [Chemical Storage Container](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/218434-REG/Delta_1_11130_Datatainer_Brown_32_oz.html){:target="_blank"} Grab 2 of these
* Some scissors
* A can opener or [film canister opener](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/100728-REG/Dot_Line_DL_6060_DLC_Film_Cassette_Opener.html){:target="_blank"}
* [A thermometer](http://amzn.to/2ySJfRO){:target="_blank"} Film developing is all about 2 things: time and temperature. The more accurate you can be the better. I've seen some others use laser thermometers and I might go that route one day too.
* Some measuring beakers. This is where I messed up. Check how big you'll need to mix the chemicals and order what you need for your particular sized developing tank. For instance, I need a large container to mix my chemicals before they get poured into the bottles but I need smaller containers to measure out the chemicals while processing. DON'T USE WHAT YOU COOK WITH. If you want to go out and buy cheap funnels and measuring devices to use for film chemistry only, fine, but don't cook with them afterwards.

Mixing the chemicals
===

As always, do this is a room with plenty of ventilation. 2 of the chemicals here come in a powder. To begin we need to mix these into stock solutions. Stock solution is a solution you can keep and use for a few months, so this process only needs to be done once in a while.

To mix the chemicals double check the instructions on the package.

The basic idea is, water plus the powder at a certain temperature. For this process I highly recommend watching some YouTube Videos on the process. [This is a great video on the entire process]()

The process
===

The process is pretty straight forward. Developer, then stop, then fixer. Times are based on your specific developer and the film you're using. There are a few options as well. I use a mix of 1 part developer to 1 part water. This will slow the
developing time, which for me is a good thing. I highly recommend an app for this called [Massive Dev](https://www.digitaltruth.com/apps/mdc/) I really like this app. Select your chemistry (Stock, 1x1, etc.) and it sets up a timer for you.

After the fixer we clean the film. then hang to dry!

What can we do with the film after we develop it?
===

There are a few options with film. If you have room and desire you can build a small dark room and make prints using
an enlarger. This process is beyond my skills and the room I have available currently. My choice is to scan the negatives. Scanning allows me to bring the images into Photoshop and alter them and eventually print them using a photo printer.

The scanning process is for another article

Overall, I found this process very interesting and rather exciting. It's a new method for myself and something
I find interesting.

Now I bring my film camera on most of my family trips, just for fun!
