Your photos are important.  Whether you're a pro, an amateur, or just a mom (or dad) with a camera, your photos will always hold some sort of value.  That value could be monetary or sentimental.  For me, I would be devastated if I lost any of the thousands of photos I have of my daughter, never mind any of my other work,  it is those photos that are most important.  With our photos being so important, it makes me wonder why we as photographers, or even everyday humans, never seem to be interested in backing up.

I've spent a good portion of my life working on computers for friends and family.  I've always been surprised by how many people never back anything up.  It is like they just assume that it'll all be there for eternity.  The truth is that hard drives fail, optical media degrades, and computers get viruses.  This post isn't meant to intimidate or scare anyone, and it certainly isn't an all encompassing lesson on backup, but rather something to think about.  In this post, I am going to detail my old method of backup, why I think it is a great solution for those less technical, and some other ideas for how you can backup.  In a future post I'm going to talk about my current backup process and why I chose to go the more technical route.  The truth is, you don't need a degree in information technology to understand the threats and protect yourself.
<h2>The Threats</h2>
There are a number of threats in this world that could destroy photographs.  In the film days things were a bit different than they are today.  Film was limited in that there was only one true original (the negative).  It could be duplicated, but if something happened to the negative, there wasn't much you could do about it.  This was of course great for copyright protection, but not very good from a backup perspective.  Today, with digital images, we can create as many copies as we desire of the original image.  This gives us a great advantage as it relates to backup.  We can have multiple copies of our original image scattered across various media.

Digital does, however, come with some drawbacks.  For one, there are a greater number of threats to those image files.  Film deteriorated over time as do physical images, but it couldn't be attacked by say a computer virus or malware.  Digital images are under assault from several threats including malware, viruses, computer errors, and even digital theft.  Let's talk about some of these different threats.


<h2>Hard Drive Crash!</h2>
So your computer is happily working one day and the next, nothing!  It's common, in fact, it is to be expected.  You shouldn't be asking yourself <strong><em>IF</em></strong> your hard disk will fail, but rather <strong><em>WHEN</em></strong>.  Your hard drive will fail, there is no doubt about it.  When is the question, and unfortunately, I can't provide a prediction for you.  The most common way to protect against hard drive failures is simple, have a backup copy of your data.  It is relatively easy to backup a hard drive, and can be as simple as using an external hard drive to copy everything from one drive to another.  Programs have been created to do just that, automatically!  We'll get into more detail on backup methods later on.
<h2>Malware &amp; Viruses</h2>
I'm sure everyone reading this has seen something wacky go on with their computer.  The truth is that malware and viruses are more than just an annoyance.  They can destroy your data, and make no mistake, your digital photos are data.  The worst I think I've ever come across is known by many names, including the FBI virus or Cryptolocker.  These are types of ransomware, meaning they literally hold your data for ransom.  For a more detailed explanation, checkout my friend's post about ransomware: <a  href="http://www.infosecsecrets.com/2016/04/10/why-you-probably-arent-immune-to-ransomware-and-why-to-backup-your-data-right-now/" target="_blank">Why You Probably aren't Immune to Ransomware...</a>

The way this works is a virus infects your computer and begins encrypting your files.  Sometimes it will display a banner on the screen telling you that you must pay to have your files released.  Why should you pay to have <strong>YOUR</strong> files released?
<h2> Physical Disaster</h2>
Physical disaster can be anything from dropping your hard drive or laptop to a fire destroying your home or even a natural disaster such as a flood.  Protection from these events can only be handled by a solid backup strategy.
<h2>The 3, 2, 1 Backup Rule</h2>
Given the threats we discussed above, I recommend and subscribe to the 3, 2, 1 Rule.  Some people see this differently, but the idea is 3 copies, 2 mediums, 1 offsite.  I've heard others also say: 3 is 2, 2 is 1, and 1 is <strong><em>none</em></strong>.  You can approach each of these "rules" in multiple different ways, and it really is up to you.  The idea is to ensure that you have a plan, and a plan that will mitigate the above threats.
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
The easiest way to backup, and where I would suggest starting if you have nothing at all, is to just get an external hard drive and copy everything over.  This doesn't really solve all of the problems, but it is a start!  Even better would be to get 2 drives and take one off site.  This doesn't cover 2 mediums as stated in the rule above, but by doing this, you are at least getting started on protecting your data.
<h2>Medium</h2>
What we mean by 2 mediums is 2 different types of storage medium.  A hard drive is one type, optical disc is another.  Now I know what you're thinking, DVD, this is 2016!  True, I've heard a lot of different arguments on using DVDs for backup.  Most these days seem to be moving away from DVD but I personally think DVDs are still a viable option for backup.

One of the worst things I can imagine happening to my images is ransom ware.  The reason is, most of my backup process, we'll discuss my entire process later on, is automated.  So if some little program managed to get into my computer and encrypt my files, there is a high degree of probability that my backups would be affected.  If timing is bad or I don't notice for a while it could completely destroy my image library!  For me, optical media solves this problem.  Using optical media, I can <em>"archive"</em> my images in a way that is non-editable, meaning I can burn once, disconnect it from the machine, and roll on.  I can do that with a hard drive as well, but at some point I have to reconnect that hard drive, and as we know, hard drives fail.  Optical media has been known to last a while and with recent advancements, I think it is becoming the perfect archive medium.  It allows you to disconnect your final line of defense against ransom ware.
<h2>M-DISC</h2>
Look out for a future post on M-DISC.  M-DISC is an optical media, like a DVD or Blu-ray, that is much stronger and will last much longer.  Think hundreds of years.
<h2>Cloud Backup?</h2>
So far, I've mentioned external drives and optical media, but what about the cloud?  The cloud is an interesting solution.  I think the cloud has a definite place in file backup, but I don't think it will ever be the end all be all.  There is only one question I have to ask that should change your mind if you think cloud is the only way to go.

<em>What happens if the company goes out of business? </em>

Sure some companies are nice and will give you your files back, but how can you be sure they'll do this BEFORE it happens.  Some other issues are, again, malware could propagate through encrypted files.  Backup speed is another issue.  It took me weeks to initially back up when I joined the cloud, and sometimes takes a few days to upload new shoots.  Security of the data is also another issue.  What if a disgruntled employee decides they want to destroy as much as they can?
<h2>My Current (Old) Backup Process</h2>
I won't pretend this is the ONLY way to backup your files, but this is my way and what works for me.  I think it covers all of my bases, and it is reasonably easy for non-technical users to master.  Some of this is automated.

A good backup starts with organization.  All of your RAW images need to be organized in one central place.  For me this is my internal 2 TB drive.  One folder on this drive named "Photo Library" is where all of my images reside.  Lightroom accesses this folder when it is looking for images, and my backup programs go here to look for changes.  This drive is also duplicated internally.  There are several ways to do this, including the backup program I talk about in a moment, but personally I use windows and create a RAID array.  What this means is that when I add a file to this drive, it is automatically copied to another 2 TB drive in the same computer.  This is the first line of defense and ensures even my most recent files (that haven't made it to my off site backups) are duplicated as soon as they are imported, and saves me if a hard drive fails.

From here I have another 2TB drive and a hot swap drive bay in my desktop, but you could use an external.  I'm using an awesome program called Syncback.  They have a free and a pro version, though I highly recommend getting the pro version!  Check them out at <a href="http://www.2brightsparks.com" target="_blank">2brightsparks.com.</a>  It will automatically copy all of the files on my 2TB internal over to my "external" 2Tb drive.  Using 2 of these I rotate these drives and one is always offsite.

My final line of defense is CrashPlan.  CrashPlan costs a few bucks a month and my files are uploaded automatically to their servers.  Like I said above, this upload takes some time, even for new files.  This all depends on your internet connection speed of course.

You'll notice I didn't talk about optical media.  That's because it is part of my new process.  I'll cover my new backup process in a later post.  It is a tad bit more technical, but it works better for me and is easier to maintain.
