Facebook has once again decided to shift it's algorithm to priorities personal profiles over pages.

The reduction in Facebook page impressions or the number of times a page is seen in your newsfeed is said to bring people together. Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg said "So the idea is to try and focus more on bringing people together by trying to put more emphasis on facilitating more meaningful social interactions between people."

The idea Facebook is implementing is to bring people together by holding content that may be interacted with at a higher value than passive content. So commenting or writing a longer comment is better in Facebook's eyes than reading a blog post. So it would seem Facebook will be shifting to show less and less of this "passive" Facebook activity.

But how does this effect businesses small and large.

Large businesses have huge teams to figure out how to move forward after the changes and I'm sure they'll be just fine, it's the small business, the small blog that might take a real hit here. just like when Google modifies it's algorithm, these small businesses and websites need to catch up and it can sometimes take time to figure out a new avenue of approach.

That said, I'm sure many reading this can agree that sometimes, there is just too much distraction in the news feed. The real concern I have is how this effects users overall. Users that liked my page obviously want my content. Personally, I don't care much to see what a friend I haven't seen in 10 years ate for breakfast, but an article from SLR lounge, absolutely!

Then there are the financial considerations. Facebook was designed around users, so the users are first but today Facebook is supported by business. Users don't pay for Facebook to operate. Businesses that advertise on Facebook pay for users to operate. Some comments I've read today indicate that this is just another grab for money from marketers. If you don't know, at one time it was completely possible to market on Facebook organically or with no advertising dollars. Back then it was genuine and meaningful and businesses took the opportunity to meet with their customers online and explore their concerns in a public, open forum. This, in my opinion was what propelled Facebook into a viable advertising space. Facebook marketing was all the rage just a few years ago but with Facebook limiting these interactions and adding the "boost post" functionality to literally everything, is Facebook really just  becoming a barrel full of people to market to like TV or Radio?

I wonder if Facebook will be cutting back it's own revenue generating notifications in our news feeds.

To be clear, all companies need to make money, they give people jobs and drive the economy, but what exactly is Facebooks' goal here?

As this all relates to photography and to photographers: We as photographers should all have a Facebook page and this just means our posts will be seen less. Over the last 5 years I've seen famous or at least YouTube famous photographers increasingly talk about Facebook Marketing. Today I saw the very ugly other side of the story. In fact it would appear that I'm not the only photographer let down by Facebook as a marketing potential, as many commenters noted, money spent, money lost, no revenue to show for it.

I honestly can't say where we go from here, other than, maybe it's time to look at other avenues of marketing or other avenues to show our work.

It would seem that some investors in Facebook also see this as a bad sign of things to come. Facebook needs a fine balance and I don't envy Mr. Zuckerberg at all. That balance needs to be very well balanced between users and businesses. Facebook needs the users because otherwise the businesses will go away but it also needs businesses because they pay the bills!

It's a catch 22 and a very fine balancing act I'm sure. Today it appeared that investors might have been a little worried about Facebook's recent news feed update, as stock prices slipped a bit today.

As for the Facebook news today, of course it's everywhere and some of it is pretty interesting to read, and some funny too!
