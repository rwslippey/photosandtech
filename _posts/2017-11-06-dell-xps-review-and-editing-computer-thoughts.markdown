I've been using the same laptop computer for over 6 years. I bought my last laptop before my daughter was born and she turned 6 in July.
That's a lot of technological advance to miss out on. Over the last several years I've been able to squeeze by with my modest
dual core processor and it's max 8GB Ram. Recently, though, it just wasn't working out.

While I own a rather powerful desktop PC which works great for editing photos, crunching numbers, and even gaming. I find
I work mobile quite a bit and a decent laptop was really overdue. All that said, it's time to take a look at the
Dell XPS 15 2017.

I purchased the Dell XPS 15 after several months of deciding if I was even going to buy a new laptop in the first place, then no less than
2 weeks of looking for the perfect fit, at a cost I was comfortable with.

I decided on the [Dell XPS 15 9560](http://amzn.to/2yuQfnx)

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-XPS9560-7001SLV-PUS-display-Aluminum-Chassis/dp/B01N1Q0M4O/ref=as_li_ss_il?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1509761015&sr=1-3&keywords=dell+xps+15+9560&linkCode=li3&tag=roberslipppho-20&linkId=129ea2a12115053f81f721ff4a2cb6bc" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01N1Q0M4O&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=roberslipppho-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=roberslipppho-20&l=li3&o=1&a=B01N1Q0M4O" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

The Specs
===

Of course the most important part of any computer isn't the name or it's manufacturer. It's what's inside that matters.

- Intel Core i7 7700HQ
- 16GB DDR4 RAM
- GTX 1060 with 4GB video RAM
- 512 GB NVME SSD
- 4k Infinity touch display
- Backlit keyboard
- Fingerprint reader

Ok, so not everything above is really required, and this "review" is also going to be a little educational. What good is
a review without telling you why I chose the specs I chose.

CPU
===

The CPU is the brains of your computer or laptop, or even phone for that matter. It's what processes almost everything
the faster the CPU, generally the better. In my case I chose the latest processor available. Not because it is the "best"
but because I still plan on using this laptop in 6 years and I want as much future compatibility as possible.

One major frustration and tripping point I found during my research into laptops and their hardware is the processor branding
Recently, intel has decided to rebrand their mobile processors, making it much harder to discern between the desktop
equivalent and the mobile processors.

For instance my processor of choice, the core i7 7700HQ, is the desktop equivalent full power quad core processor. The
7700Y*** on the other hand is actually a mobile processor, offering significant power savings but at a huge cost. It's
got less cores and less threads. It may look nearly the same but it could be a huge difference in performance depending on the task. They both share the same core i7 name though. This makes it a little confusing.

RAM
===

RAM isn't really much of an issue these days, in my humble opinion. RAM is simply the memory your computer has. RAM stands
for Random Access Memory. Meaning this is where your computer stores information before it is sent to the processor. This
isn't your more permeant hard drive storage, but temporary. Generally the more ram the better performance you can expect.
There are also different types of RAM. Recently DDR4 has become the new norm for major PC users, specifically gamers and power
users. It's becoming mainstream now. DDR3 was king for a while, but it's falling back a bit. Truthfully, I don't know you
would see much improvement over DDR3. Modern, as recent as 2017 seem to all support DDR4 so it's the way we're going.

The amount of RAM you need strongly depends on what you expect to do. For photo editing it's a good idea to check your software of choices' specs but I've found a least 8GB to be a minimum. If your doing video I'd get as much as you reasonably can. Keep in mind that video production and increasingly photo editing can utilize the GPU for some tasks but having more RAM will definitely help.

GPU
===

The GPU can be argued as not important or extremely important. The GPU is your graphical processor unit. It processes
graphics. GPU support has recently been introduced into Adobe Photoshop Lightroom CC, as of a few years ago. I would expect
this support to broaden and be the future of heavy image processing applications going forward, so a good GPU is a must for
my longer term investment.

A GPU is also extremely, if not more, important to video editors. I don't edit video but a GPU will improve
the time it takes to work with video files and mostly export that video. Again, I'm not a video guy, but if I were (or planned to become)
I'd definitely go for a desktop style GPU (which is what we have here in this XPS 15).

NVME
===

So this where things get a little more interesting. You're probably saying, why only 512 GB for the hard drive? Well, I technically
don't have a hard drive in my computer. Hard drives were those noisy things you heard spinning around in your old laptop or PC.
They store data similar to a CD but on magnetic plates instead. These plates spin as a head reads the plates. Because they need to spin,
they're often slow in comparison to the much newer flash media we see today. Flash media is found everywhere today. Your cell phone, tablet,
even your camera uses flash media. SD and CF cards are flash media. It's storage that doesn't require a spinning disk.

Without that spinning disk, these storage methods are much faster, especially for random reads because the head doesn't have to go find where
it put that bit of data on the drive plate. One side effect of these newer drives is they're much more expensive and their size is reduced.
This XPS came with a 512 GB SSD or a 1TB SSD. In my case I was impatient and couldn't find the 1TB SSD so I figured I'll wait for a while and
upgrade it later on.

Recently, we've seen a reduction in the size of these SSD storage units too. An M.2 SSD is half the size and possibly half the thickness of
a laptop hard drive and it can be attached directly to the motherboard, meaning faster speeds yet again through the use of PCI express lanes.
In programs like Adobe Lightroom. Storing your catalog on this fast drive ensures a much deserved performance boost. In fact most computer speed
issues can be the direct result of slow drive performance. Today it's not unusual for a PC to boot in a second or two, when just a few years ago
it could take a few minutes on the fastest hardware. The primary reason is the storage. The storage drive is able to read files faster and thus
transfer them to the RAM and then the processor faster. A faster processor with slow storage just bottlenecks the whole process.

The rest of it
===

Honestly, the rest isn't of major concern. The 4k display was a nice to have (and I'll add I really like it) but
both displays that come with the XPS 15 are acceptable for photo editing and can be considered color accurate.

The fingerprint reader, that's up to you. I didn't expect mine until it showed up with one but it's REALLY nice to login with a finger instead of a password. I will note that it sometimes misses the reading, quite a few times in a row. Sometimes I manage to get it locked out and have to enter my password or pin.

The results
===

This thing is AWESOME! I love this laptop. It's been a long time since I've felt like I wasn't waiting on a computer to do
something. Now I can't keep up with it instead of the other way around. It's quite most of the time, having only needing
it's fans spun up when it gets hot, which is usually when I'm exporting RAW photos. It does get a little loud when it's doing this
but it's nothing to write home about.

The screen is fantastic. I opted for the 4k touch screen because I really wanted a good looking screen. I read after the fact
that some thought the screen presented too many glares and those photographers preferred the 1080 display instead. While I have
seen some glare on the screen, it's nothing that bothers me too much and simply facing a good direction prevents the problem altogether.

The keyboard is great as well. It has taken a little to get used to but I find it comfortable enough to type on that I can sit
on my couch and write this with a small laptop desk. Most laptops I'd find myself on the desktop for long posts such as this or even
short emails. The keys move less than I am used to, but it's the nature of the beast, it's a small laptop, what else can you expect.

Size is pretty much perfect. I can't complain about the size of this thing at all. It's a perfect fit for me. Some prefer smaller, some prefer larger.
I figured if I went any smaller, I'd need a big screen wherever I used it. Any bigger and I'd be lugging a laptop bag around. The 15 inch is perfect for me
but I think it's personal preference. With the infinity edge display it's actually smaller than another other 15 inch laptop I've owned. The bezel around the screen is much smaller.

Speaking of the bezel, if you do any video chatting, you might have an issue with the XPS 15. For me it's not a problem but the camera is below the screen giving a really weird angle to any videos. Personally, if I really needed the webcam I'd just bring another with me. Food for thought though.

All in all I'd say the Dell XPS 15 is a great laptop.

My estimate of the future
===

One thing seems clear to me. After getting the Dell XPS 15, I don't have much of a need for a full size desktop anymore.
The XPS packs a punch and is light, portable, and elegant. I don't see myself in the future ever investing in a
dedicated editing machine for the desk. The Dell XPS has an [optional docking station](http://amzn.to/2xZoCP4) that can be used to connect both
wired Ethernet and a full size screen. The docking station utilizes a single thunderbolt connector to connect to
all of your desktop accessories without needing to plug in a bunch of different cables. While I haven't purchased the
dock yet, I see the future editing desk being a laptop similar to the XPS, if not a future model of the XPS and this dock.

What's really interesting is the advancements in technology not now allow you to add an external GPU to your XPS or many other laptops I'd assume, in a similar
fashion to the current thunderbolt dock. While expensive, the technology is there and future refinements will definitely
be coming. Truthfully, the XPS can serve as a complete editing machine, in my opinion, and is comparable to a full sized
desktop, without the heft. The future can only improve these technologies and I can't wait to see what it holds for us.
