title: Wannacry virus creates disaster
date: 2017-05-15
teaser: With the recent questioning of practices by the CEO of Facebook, I’ve seen a lot of misinformation and frankly a lot of really bad understanding among its users and the public. The recent questions by congress show that some of our lawmakers just don’t understand technology and recent comments online say the same thing of users of the very platform.

If you're not aware, you should probably wake up, a devastating computer virus has hit the world again. The virus known as "wannacry" has been credited with causing havoc all over the world, including sending England's National Health Service into chaos, disrupting car manufacturing, banks, and even Spanish telecommunications. I thought now would be a good time to talk about how we can mitigate some of the potential hazards a virus like this can have on photographers and creatives in general.

## Yes, I know, I've beat this drum enough... BACKUP!



I received an email from my employer's "IT" department just yesterday instructing me to "backup". I don't really think this is the full story. If you remember my old backup article, you'll remember that we discussed backing up and the different types and the pros and cons of each. Wannacry is reported to be a ransomware virus, meaning it infects your computer and encrypts your files. Knowing the different types of backup can be the difference between wasting your time and having a viable backup to recover from.

In most consumer friendly, backup software today, the process is automated. You install a program and it pushes your files offsite to the "cloud". This is great because it's giving you an offsite backup but that program on your computer monitors for changes to your files, so if and when a virus like wannacry comes along and starts encrypting those files, your backup program is just going to send those new files right up to the cloud. Next thing you know, your important photos, videos, documents are all encrypted and you then realize your backups are encrypted too.

Now, I'll note that some backup programs offer a versioning feature that holds onto multiple versions of your backup. This will help protect against this situation because it keeps the old file, when the file is changed on your computer, it sends up another copy of the file or just the changes to the cloud and keeps a copy of the old one for a record. This can help prevent ransomware from overwriting your backups, but I'd still argue the best way to go is with an off-site, offline backup.

## What do I mean by Off-site?

A backup to CD/DVD or a hard drive should always include some type of media off-site. Meaning, if you backup your pictures to a hard drive, don't leave the hard drive in your house! Robberies, fires, and floods will all still destroy that backup so it's best to keep copies at multiple locations so you have a backup to your backup.

## What do I mean by off-line?

Quite simply, a manually processed backup. Most experts say an automated backup is best because you don't have to do anything. It does everything for you, so you're more inclined to actually backup your files. Like I explained above, a manual backup process can protect against ransomware because it's manual. You have to put a drive into a computer and then take that drive somewhere after the files are copied over.

To be clear, I don't mean manually copying the files. I mean some type of manual user intervention needs to take place. So you put a drive in, fire a program or script to backup your computer and then come back and remove the drive when it's done. It adds in that physical layer of backup that a virus can't corrupt, only a human can. It also helps get your files backed up quicker. Internet speeds are amazing now days but it still takes months to completely backup my photo library, hard drives are much faster, limiting the time something bad could happen.

## So I should get rid of my cloud backup?

No, of course not. No one plan is bullet proof. Like investing, you should never put all of your eggs in one basket. Spread them out. Have your cloud backup plus a hard drive you backup to weekly or when you shoot a wedding or a large shoot.

## My backup plan

My backup plan looks like this. Keep in mind I have a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. All of my computers backup to the NAS daily. This is for odd files that are on the desktop which could be spreadsheets I'm working on or anything really. The photos I'm working on are backed up separately to the NAS from my "Jobs in progress" directory. This is automated to run every hour to ensure it's always backed up. Once files are copied from my laptop to my NAS I now have 2 copies of those files, putting my mind at ease. Because this is locally network attached it's also very fast, so it limits the worry time where things could be lost.

Now my laptop always goes with me so technically you could say I have an off-site backup but, my laptop is always with me so if my house burns down in the middle of the night, well there went all my backups. So I rotate a hard drive weekly. I have one drive that stays at work and one that stays at home. Every week I pull the one at home out and take it to work, then drop the one from work into the server for updating. My NAS also features versioning as explained above, so I have the ability to revert files.

Finally, my last line of defense is cloud backup. Truth be told I’m not completely happy with my cloud backup so I won’t mention any names here. I don’t like the software it comes with and its backup servers are rather slow. For now it does what I need it to do though and I just live with it but I’m always looking for a better solution.

## Final point
If you don’t have anything, go out now and buy a hard drive and at least backup your data to that one drive. Something is better than nothing! [This Seagate Expansion 2TB Portable External Hard Drive on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2KdsjHv){:target="_blank"} will be enough to at least afford you some protection. I can't say it enough though, backup!
