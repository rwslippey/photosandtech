title: A Pocket Tripod, Review of the Platpod Pro
date: 2016-06-31
teaser: I have to admit, when I first heard about the Platypod Pro a few months ago, I didn't think it would be of much use to me, but about 2 months ago while out for a "photo hike" with my wife, I found myself using rocks to prop my camera and lens up to take slow shutter shots of a small stream.

I have to admit, when I first heard about the Platypod Pro a few months ago, I didn't think it would be of much use to me, but about 2 months ago while out for a "photo hike" with my wife, I found myself using rocks to prop my camera and lens up to take slow shutter shots of a small stream.

Truth be told, my rock method worked rather well. I was able to get a few nice shots at slower shutter speeds, although bumping the camera a time or two didn't help matters. Not having a cable release was probably also another issue as well. All in all it did work rather well, but it would have been nice to have more flexibility.

That pocket tripod would have come in real handy in this situation. Which, I would imagine, is exactly why my wife decided it would make a great Christmas present! Hint: She was right.

The Platypod Pro is such a simple piece of gear, I find myself almost dumb founded that I didn't think of it. The idea is that the camera sits on a ball head, which is in turn mounted on a specially designed metal plate. The plate has several holes in it for mounting in different configurations or using included spikes that can be used to support the plate on rocks and other weird places.

### First impression
This thing is a tank! The plate is solid, there is nothing else that can be said about this. On the Platypod Pro website they say "The Platypod Proâ„¢ is constructed of a 4mm thick rigid plate of aircraft grade aluminum measuring 3x5." Enough said there. I will say this though, it doesn't feel aluminum to me at all, it feels solid yet still very light weight.<br/><br/>

### What's included with the Platypod Pro?
Included with my kit was the previously discussed plate, 3 spikes, 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch spigot adapter. The kit also includes a very nice, expandable, carry case and carabiner to clip onto your camera bag. The bag appears very well made and to my surprise it flips out to double it's size, enabling you to fit not only the Platypod and all of it's accessories but also a ball head.

One really important note on the ball head is to make sure whatever knob is used to tighten the ball is small. If the knob is too large it will hit the Platypod and you'll be unable to lock down the ball head at all, leaving your camera sagging. The Oben ball head pictured above has a larger knob, but you can pull the knob to freely rotate it to a better position and then re-tighten it.

### How does the Platypod Pro work?
I was moderately perplexed at first but the Platypod is pretty simple to figure out. The plate includes 2 different sized mounting posts. This enables you to mount not only a ball head but other studio equipment such as flashes and such. Three of the holes on the plate are threaded and include 3 spikes that get inserted into the Platypod. These spikes include pointed ends to dig in and hold onto whatever it is your putting this on. I found the screws gripped well on rocks and wood, but do be careful on desks and furniture as it might scratch them, although I didn't try it, It appears the crew at Platypod thought of that already too. They included rubber covers for these screws as well. The threaded screws allow you to adjust the Platypod to ensure it is level and to adjust it's weight distribution.

The other holes in the Platypod are not threaded and this allows you to mount the plate to almost anything. The manufacture recommends screws or zip ties.

One thing to keep in mind is that to ensure weight is centered over the plate properly, you'll want to ensure the lens of your camera is pointed down the plate, keeping it balanced. This is a simple task with all of the adjustable screws previously mentioned.

### Platypod Pro Field Test
So not to waste any time, I decided to take to the field with my new tripod. I did take my regular tripod along with me. My destination was a easy level hike through Brandywine Creek State Park in Northern Delaware. I usually don't stick to the primary trails when hiking around Brandywine Creek. I try to stay close to the streams and creek for water imagery. I'm also known to not exactly stick to a trail at all, and get out on the rocks of the stream. This can make carrying a tripod a little difficult at times.

My first couple of shots were with my regular tripod but eventually I tried out the Platypod on a rock near my primary tripod. At first I was a little fearful it would fall into the water, but it didn't move an inch. It sat solidly on the rock without issue the entire time, as I made change after change to composition, settings, zoom ranges, ect.

The platypod really shined later on when I got up close to a tiny water fall. By tiny I mean, a foot of water and this thing would disappear, but non the less, it's what we have here, so we work with it. I went straight to the Platypod, and after about half an hour of shooting different angles and such, I noticed that I would not have been able to get that shot on a tripod without the Platypod. The rock formations would have made it difficult, if not impossible to position a tripod properly for my composition.

### Conclusion


The Platypod Pro is, in my eyes, a great piece of gear for the walking about/hiking type photographer. It makes a great support for when you don't want to or can't carry a regular tripod, but I also found that it can sometimes be an alternative to a regular tripod, say when you can't get a regular tripod in where you'd like to for your desired angle or composition. To be clear, it's not a replacement for a regular tripod but another tool in your arsenal of photo gear.
