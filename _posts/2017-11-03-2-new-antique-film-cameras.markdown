I've been looking for a while for an older camera to play around with or just one to put on the shelf as something interesting to look at. Well, the wait is over and I've finally picked up 2 new (or should I say new to me) old film cameras, and at a great deal too!

I've wanted to try 4x5 film for a very long time but I never purchased a camera for 4x5 so recently my wife mentioned an antique store near our home. Last Friday she decided to stop in and mentioned that they had a few "old cameras". After going back and forth for a while via text she sent me an image of an old box camera and an old Kodak Kodex! I had to stop in to take a look, but even more interesting was that the box camera still had film in it!

Fast forward a few hours later and I purchased the box camera and the Kodex for $25 for both of them. I think the only real reason I bought the box camera was that it still had film in it, but it's still interesting, non the less.

## The No. 2A Brownie Camera Model B.

I haven't yet figured out when this version was made but I'll post an update here when I do.

This model was introduced in Oct 1901 and Discontinued is 1935. For being around for 82 years though, it doesn't look bad. It does look it's seen better days though.

It's seen better days, but for $5 it's an interesting camera to have around. I've noticed rust almost everywhere and the leather is starting to tear around the corners. I might look into how to carefully correct some of the issues with it or I might just leave it as is. Any recommendation are always welcome.

The really interesting thing is the film I found STILL IN THE CAMERA when I got it!
When I got the camera it had, already in it, a roll of KodaColor-X from Kodak. As best as I've found this particular film hasn't been produced since 1974. Unfortunately, I don't think there were any images on the film as when I got the camera it hadn't yet been advanced to "1". I do still plan on getting the film developed but since it's color, I'll need to send it out to a lab that supports the C-22 process. I currently process my own black and white film, but not color.

## Kodak Kodex No.1

This brings us to the Kodex. This camera looks in surprisingly good condition.

I ordered some 120 film for this camera to give it a go but I held off due to time constraints and a slight light leak in the bellows. I'm still doing some more research on where this one came from and some more details.




## Summary

So honestly I think this was just a little something of interest. It's not particularly educational yet, but I'm hoping to get these old things working a bit and have some fun. I already shoot film pretty regularly with my dad's old 35mm Pentax. I've learned to develop black and white film as well so maybe that'll be another post here as well.

What's your thoughts on old film cameras? Found anything interesting?
