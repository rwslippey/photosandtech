I decided a few weeks ago to start going through my gallery, in the midst of all my other projects, and see what could I find to put up on some of the major micro-stock
photography sites. This entire idea started with a podcast and a book.

After listening to Jim Harmer of Improve Photography talk with author and microstock photographyer, Steve Heap. Be sure to checkout [Improve Photography](http://www.ImprovePhotography.com)
and Steve Heap's blog at [BackYardSilver.com](http://www.BackYardSilver.com). I decided to give it a go, but before I get into the details, lets look at why I came to this decision.

For years I've wanted to dive into stock. I avoided it because of all the photographers saying the industry is too saturated and that image quality has to be top notch. To be honest
I never thought my images would be accepted. I'm a competent photographer but I think there are a huge mass of much better photographers out there than myself.

Some reasons I pulled the trigger this time

* I have nothing to loose.
* My images are just sitting otherwise
* I think shooting stock gives me more practice
* Maybe, with hard work and dedication, I can make a decent extra income

To clarify, I think you should understand my expectation. I don't expect to get rich off stock photography. I also don't expect to live off stock photography in my forseable future.
I do however expect that shooting new stock images will give me more practice in my craft and will help me to better myself as a photographer. Finally there is one other, major, reason
I decided to try stock.

Passive Income
===

Passive income is the holy grail of success in my book. I can work 40 hours a week at a job and make money, I can shoot wedding and possibly make more or less money (depending on my business skills).
With passive income, on the other hand, I can make money while I sleep, play with my kids, relax with my family, or enjoy retirment. Speaking of retirement, wouldn't a large 10,000 image
library on the major stock sites producing a few hundred or thousand dollars a year be a great way to improve my quality of life? Apsolutly! I should note that my reasearch of other
photographers in stock, who have large libraries and stop contributing see a very quick drop off of sales very quickly, but as I get older, I still expect to enjoy photography
and still expect to take photos and if microstock can help me fund a few photo trips a year I consider it a win, I get to do what I enjoy, and keep filling the library.

The goals are simple:

* Don't expect to get rich
* Approach stock like an experiment
* Approach stock like a retirement income (but don't ever rely solely on it, or at all)

 and finally

* Approach stock as a way to get a few extra dollars (or cents) for what you already do, and love to do!

Getting Started
===

I won't go into details on getting started in stock photography, for that I recommend Steve's book. Even if you don't want to get into stock, it's a good read. Steve is also very active
on forums and replied to my comments on his website very quickly! So again, checkout [backyardsilver.com](http://www.backyardsilver.com)

So far I submit to Shutterstock, Adobe Stock, Dreamstime, and 123RF. With only a handful of images uploaded, I think I've got the process down so far and going forward
I'll be uploading many more photos. I should note that I've got a lot more images to upload, but I am in the middle of transistioning to Capture One Pro 10 from Lightroom so that's
kind of taking higher priority at this point.

Results so far
===

So what have a earned so far? Within about 3 week I earned one sale, a $.50 commission. It's not much, but like I said above, my expectation are not to get rich and it means one thing
to me and that is that I am doing something right. Now to get more images uploaded and to get to producing some new images!

Update
===

My earns have grown a bit over the last few months, still nothing to write home about but, it's still fun. I've gotten a few more images up, albeit not nearly as many as I had hoped but it's proving to be a motivator for me to at least try and get creative, now if I could just figure out where a put all that spare time I had, oh wait I don't have any!

I highly recommend reading Steve's book which can be found here on Amazon: [Getting Started in Stock: 2017 Edition of the guide to microstock photography](http://amzn.to/2vVXArr)
Another book I'd recommend is [Brutally Honest Guide to Microstock Photography: turning Stock Photos Into Cash](http://amzn.to/2vjKSWv) I'm still reading this, but it's a good read so far.
