I think it is safe to say that most people don't fully understand how the Internet works. Don't be offended though. I by no way mean that as an insult. The Internet is indeed vast and complex

Squarespace sent me an email today. Be on the lookout for my upcoming Squarespace review. If you don't know Squarespace is a website that allows you to build your own
website, very easily. The email today was to announce that you can now secure your websites with SSL.

## What is SSL
SSL stands for secure socket layer. It is a website technology that ensures traffic from your computer and websites is encrypted. This prevents people on the net
from "sniffing" or spying on what your sending back and forth. SSL has been popular with banks and email such as Gmail for years. Online stores also use SSL to
protect customers credit card data. As a user you don't need to do anything to setup SSL, it is setup on the web site end. It's always a good idea to make sure
your on a secure site before entering your credit card information on the site. The easiest way is to look for the lock symbol in your browser's address bar.
Another signal that the site is using SSL is when you see "https" in the address. HTTP is not secure, HTTPS IS secure.

## Why should I care? I don't sell online and I'm obviously not a bank!
Recently, there has been a movement to "secure the web" By that I mean in recent years companies and people have been trying to push all websites, not just
banks and online stores to become secure and use SSL. One of the major motivating factors now is that Google has joined the fight to secure the web as well.

## SEO & SSL
[Google has recently announced](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html) that it will start to factor weather the site uses SSL into its search algorithm. Meaning your website might get bonus points
or be knocked down by other websites simply because you do or don't have SSL setup on your website. This is more than just Google Search though. Google's
vast enterprise doesn't just include Google Search. It includes countless smaller search engines that utilize Google as their back end. Additionally Google
owns and control the popular Chrome browser. Long story short, if you want your website to have the best possible chance of being successful in the search engines
you might want to setup SSL.

## Squarespace and SSL
Squarespace announced today in an email to customers that it will be offering free SSL support for all Squarespace websites utilizing [Let's Encrypt](http://sg-links.squarespace.com/wf/click?upn=WNHqXi6oIZp1jTG-2Fn-2B67u3cSj7yxyxg-2B-2BPxWYLDaH-2FY-3D_5nPFJsNJdUBvxjk1gg3WdrTN-2BA-2BQNleRGcdHkyPpL1Y1Wiy59sIpy2d406UYAHFw18TdAYKrMe-2FdJFeyh-2FR83fbnGT27fxBr62vHLwnygCaGkqBmQmXg-2FpArR-2Bkr-2FiFvX9jOOLcpSlPMHhpZK8Wfc74oP0WnEXfbHWnHtqEjI8jxyamYExDKUZCQokWTRcyr2kNsvNZooL5LNAs-2BpXSYgYGlolYp72hK9m0VbAKONB-2BdEPV8cKTg3X3HaKHk8b1oRtXvJwyj63LvF3XZy-2Fle8eKlY3IDvwV2SAbl5urxyqmjK1kGkFZxn02sgR8M6Mzfn63E2Z8oMK-2FgzmoDXpYmZVFuhGU62OmS6tyJHRQYe2DOGsxafnWXB-2BCSQ1NABnSTvumT4e7C9o3dTXAYlbRHWO1xS9iGCSjqa6EncwEddEB8JfUI8g-2FUVJIyrm3gJm6-2F)
You can find instructions on enabling SSL on [Squarespaces's SSL help guide](http://sg-links.squarespace.com/wf/click?upn=WNHqXi6oIZp1jTG-2Fn-2B67u9Id-2FqN9qxtkhpJlJHgY7Q6yZPLDw7b87p7u-2B5KwrKyZwZ0agimJ-2FmIpvymXjRqgdP-2FRha4FvizHraJA1P6cYr8-3D_5nPFJsNJdUBvxjk1gg3WdrTN-2BA-2BQNleRGcdHkyPpL1Y1Wiy59sIpy2d406UYAHFw18TdAYKrMe-2FdJFeyh-2FR83fbnGT27fxBr62vHLwnygCaGkqBmQmXg-2FpArR-2Bkr-2FiFvX9jOOLcpSlPMHhpZK8Wfc74oP0WnEXfbHWnHtqEjI8jxyamYExDKUZCQokWTRcyr2kNsvNZooL5LNAs-2BpXSYgYGlolYp72hK9m0VbAKONB-2BdEPV8cKTg3X3HaKHk8b1o2wQe3pW7hyQ-2FarIbapNhRTZRb4rh5CoLOtR1mzx3nGk2IoTykx8OWHliwz21D4b3N1pvOxLXdWtvk5mB6Sycg2WIKsMET5wxRw5I-2FBvo9b31SU5vBPswvnj-2Fiw8KPVEftRMUy3o6k4P55aKEhFw3jU-2F7W1bradTtB5TvrNe-2BcJUxecokmLklOz4w2n4vhBtB)
I would note that Squarespace offering SSL for Free is and their implementation seems to make it easy for users to setup. Contrast that to setting it up yourself on
shared hosting or your own server, it's an awesome deal. So thanks Squarespace!

One final note: If you notice this website isn't just about photography. As a photographer and self proclaimed geek, I know some technical tasks photographers are
required to do or should do for their websites, computer, or businesses, might be difficult. The point here is that I'd like to convey my experience and knowledge
to help others in their pursuit.
