It took me a long time to realize that I was never going to learn or
get recognition for any of my work until I started sharing it. People need to see your work to appreciate it or enjoy it.

That said, photography isn't just about how many likes you can get on Facebook or how many people share your work. Photography is for ourselves. We as photographers
need to create work we enjoy. The saying "You can't love someone else until you love yourself" holds true here as well.

Don't let you likes or followers, or lack thereof prevent you from showing off your work. It takes a lot of drive and determination to just shoot and to
forget about everything else. As a self identified introvert I still struggle with this.

To this day I feel awkward or weird taking my camera out in public or in front of people but I've made a promise to myself that I will shoot today and I will shoot everyday
to improve my craft and create images I enjoy.
