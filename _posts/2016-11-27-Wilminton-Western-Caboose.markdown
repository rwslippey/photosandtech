I don't know why but I really wanted to share this image here. I'm still working on my portfolio page so I've decided to just embed this from my 500px.com accounts. By the way, feel free to checkout [Rob Slippey Photography on 500px.com](https://500px.com/robslippey) Sadly, it too is still a work in progress. Please checkout some of my images and as always, please drop a like on any images you think deserve it.

The family and I took a trip on the Wilmington & Western Railroad back in July. While not really a photo trip, I did get a few good photos. My 5 year old daughter had a blast, and to be honest, so did my 70+ year old grandmother! I can't say I had a bad time either. All in all, I would highly recommend a trip on the Wilminton & Western Railroad, if you get the opportunity.

So what about the photo. This was a weird one. I was kind of a annoyed, at the fact that I couldn't frame the image the way I intended. This was largly due to the summer growth around the tracks were the train was parked. If you don't know, the train takes regular trips to Mount Cuba along the Red Clay creek. This particular trip stopped at a picnic area and that is where the photo was taken.

In my mind after taking a few rushed shots (4 year olds aren't patient when it comes to photography) I had discarded the idea of this image, thinking it was a loss. Fast forward to this past week and I took another look and relized I REALLY like the weird composition. It's different. I don't know if that's why I like it but, it is different and it makes me enjoy looking at this particular image.

The point here, I guess, is that even if you initially don't like an image, who knows, in 6 months of even 10 years you might come back and change your mind. Another point can be made that just being original stands out?

Thanks for checking it out and reading!
