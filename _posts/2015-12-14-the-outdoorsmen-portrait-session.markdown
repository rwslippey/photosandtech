title: The Outdoorsmen Portrait Session
date: 2015-12-14
teaser: I recently did an outdoor portrait session with a friend and colleague. We were discussing some outdoor water photos I had taken over the weekend at Brandywine Creek State Park, in Delaware, when we came up with the idea of doing an environmental portrait of outdoor enthusiast doing the things that they enjoy. In his case this was fishing. I can honestly say I had a blast doing this portrait (no fish were caught in the making of these images). This is obviously not your everyday portrait session. Wading was involved, so not exactly for everyone, but it was an interesting opportunity to get out and shoot.

I recently did an outdoor portrait session with a friend and colleague. We were discussing some outdoor water photos I had taken over the weekend at Brandywine Creek State Park when we came up with the idea of doing an environmental portrait of outdoor enthusiast doing the things that they enjoy. In his case this was fishing. I can honestly say I had a blast doing this portrait (no fish were caught in the making of these images). This is obviously not your everyday portrait session. Wading was involved, so not exactly for everyone, but it was an interesting opportunity to get out and shoot.

As I said above, this was an interesting experience. I would suggest anyone attempting such a shoot come prepared. In my case, I've never had a use for waders before. In case you don't know, waders are a type of suit fishermen wear to enable them to walk or wade through water. They're sealed so water can't get in and you can walk through streams without getting wet.

As I said, this was my first time doing something like this, so I hit the internet and did some research. For simplicity, there are 2 basic types of waders: neoprene and breathable.

Neoprene waders are from my experience not comfortable at all. They're heavy, thick, and tight. I dreaded the idea of walking any more than 10 steps in these type. At the same time though, I was skeptical of breathable waders. Breathable waders are of a thinner material, almost like a rain coat. Like I said I was skeptical, but I assure you I remained completely dry the entire trip.

Waders also come with a selection of options. First off they make hip, waist, and chest waders. The differences here are obvious. One important thing to consider is that some waders have built in boots and some have a stocking foot. With the latter you'll need a wading boot. Things seem to get much more expensive around the boots. I will note though that with the rubber boots in my waders, which have a built in boot, I found walking on some rocks tricky. My subject had no difficulty in his wading boots, but I found the rocks very slippery in my rubber boots. I managed to stay upright though.

I am fortunate enough to have a local Cabela's store, so I was able to go into the store and ask a few questions, again never having needed waders before. What I ended up with were Herter's Men's Breathable Waders. As I said I'm rather happy with these. Full review to come soon.

### "Dress for Success"

It will get cold. My waders, being of the breathable type, didn't have any insulation. I'd suggest dressing for the weather and remember that just because the air is warm doesn't mean the water will be. For the most part I was comfortable in long thermal pants and jeans over top. I did double my socks and included wool socks on the outside as well. A note on jeans though,  it's recommended not to wear jeans as they'll hold in sweat. In my case this was immediately apparent as I took the waders off. It's like getting out of the shower when it's cold. I could feel the moisture on the jeans. Thankfully this was a short shoot so it didn't affect me all that much, but food for thought non-the-less.

I'll admit, I thought about skipping the waders altogether, but opted the night before to pick a pair up. I'm glade I did too. without the waders I would have been very limited in my composition. I can say with 100% confidence that without having the ability to walk through the water, I would have not gotten the shots that I did. The angles would have never worked.

### The Plan that went completely out the window

Our Plan from the start was to arrive early, more specifically 0'dark thirty and wait until just after sunrise to begin our hike in. We arrived way earlier than we had hoped and ended up waiting nearly an hour for sunrise. Once we began our hike in and found our location, it was clear that the sky was not going to cooperate. The original intent was to include some morning fog in the photo. Upon arrival though, we had no fog. I guess I need to remember next time to check the weather.

My first few shots were extremely high ISO as it wasn't very bright out yet. Eventually the sky brightened up a bit and we were able to get some great shots. Something I hadn't thought of ahead of time was the backgrounds I'd be faced with. This being November, the fall colors were gone, all that remained was brush without any green, orange, or red. There really wasn't much though in how I would deal with the backgrounds, but non-the less I am happy with the way things turned out.

### Camera Gear

I was also worried about my camera gear as well. My first few steps in the water made me understand the true power of water. The current in some areas will be strong and the slippery rocks (yes I know my name is Slippey) made me think about how one false move could be a double kill. The bag on my back getting wet and me. If I get wet, it's an immediate threat. Get back to the car and get warm, but my camera gear getting wet might be a long term issue. I was considering [A Waterproof Dry Bag (Affiliate Link)](http://amzn.to/2eGEIaC) However, I never did. It is on the list of things to do. I'm still working on what sizing I want and how I'd pack the gear into my existing camera bags.

For this trip I used a [Canon Deluxe Photo Backpack (Affiliate Link)](http://amzn.to/2eadEO5) Which I got used when I bought my used Canon 5D. For the most part the backpack worked out great. Its sturdy enough and comfortable enough to do some decent walking with and carried most of the gear I needed.

My gear included my 5D, 70-200mm f/2.8, Sigma 24-70 f/2.8, Slik tripod, Canon 60D, and my UFW angle lens the new 10-18MM.

I probably could have lightened the load, but not being sure what I was getting into, I wanted options, and as I said the bag was able to handle it.
