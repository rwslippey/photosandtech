In my last post I talked about your camera's "modes" As a reminder, they are Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, and Manual. Well, those are the basics, and the basis for this article. One of the single best things you can do to improve your photography is learn to work in manual. By that I mean you set the shutter, aperture, and ISO. I know, we didn't talk about ISO yet, we'll get to it in this post.

## So Why do I need to get out of auto?

Auto exposure allows the camera to make all of the decisions when it comes to exposure. Understanding exposure will give you a better idea of why exactly this isn't always the best idea. For starters though, a camera is similar to a computer in it's calculations of the exposure. It is 100% scientific. It doesn't understand that your kid is standing in the shadow of a bright scene or that the sun is at your subject's back or that you want the whole scene in focus or just certain parts. It understands one thing and one thing only: 18% grey. That's it, you're camera is adjusting exposure for 18% grey. Since we humans aren't generally interested in "18% grey" This doesn't really help us. This all means that in the majority of cases, we will see better results by telling our camera exactly what to do. I will caution you though, getting the hang of these settings will take time. Be patient and just practice, eventually, you'll start to understand how everything plays together.

## There is not 1 right or wrong setting to use

Lets be honest, photography is very subjective. Just like there is no set "rule" for a good or bad picture, there is no set rule for what settings you should use for a given scenario. There are however, guidlines. For instance, If your shooting a landscape, you'd want a smaller aperture or if your shooting sports a faster shutter speed. I'll explain all of these as we go on. Just keep in mind that changing one setting might require a change of another, and there isn't always 1 set of setting to use.

## The exposure triangle

To understand exposure, you must understand the exposure triangle. The triangle refers to 3 different settings and their relationship to one another. All 3 settings play a role in the overall exposure of an image. This is very similar to the fire triangle, which consist of 3 required items; Oxygen, fuel, & heat/ignition source. If you remove any of the 3 elements you will either not a fire or will extinguish the fire. Similarly, you have ISO, shutter speed, and aperture. If you have a perfectly exposed photo and change just one of those settings, your photo will then be over exposed or underexposed, depending on which way to changed the setting.

The exposure triangle refers to the 3 things that make up exposure. Those 3 things are
*	ISO
*	Shutter Speed
*	Aperture

## ISO

Lets talk about ISO: ISO determines how sensitive your camera's sensor is to light. We won't go in depth to what all of the numbers mean right now, but the higher the number the more sensitive your camera's sensor is to light, meaning the brighter your images. If you can remember the film days, this is very similar to film speeds. An example of this would be that on a bright afternoon you could take a photo at 200 ISO or even lower, but go indoors and you need to raise your ISO to 800 or higher to get a decent photo. Everything is a trade off though, and ISO is no exception. With higher ISO comes higher noise. Noise is little specs of digital "dust" in your photos. It is what you might call grain in older photos. It is best to keep your ISO as low as possible but don't be scared to bring it up if need be, as you'll see in the next section, shutter speed can ruin a photo.

## Shutter Speed

Shutter speed is probably the most important setting and is the single reason most of my first photos were thrown away. Shutter speed refers to the amount of time your sensor is exposed to the light. Again we won't go into numbers but know that the lower the number the longer the sensor "sees" light. The higher the less it "sees" light. Think about that for a moment though because the trade off here is blur. A low shutter speed can produce motion blur, either by your movement while hand holding your camera or your subjects movement. This is where ISO is important. don't be afraid to bring your ISO up to get a faster shutter speed. A little bit of grain is better than a blurry ruined photo. Shutter speed also allows for some creativity though. You may want some motion blur your photos. Aviation photography is one particularly dependent on this. If you take a photo of an airplane's propeller at too fast of a shutter speed the prop will appear to be stopped in mid air. It looks weird and makes me wounder sometimes if the engines failed! Slowing that shutter speed down will give you some smooth prop movement making the images appear as if the propeller is turning. Waterfalls are another area where you can get creative with shutter speed!

## Aperture

Aperture is the opening of the aperture in your lens. This is similar to the pupil in your eye. The bigger the opening the more light that is being let in (for us humans that means it's dark out) In bright light our pupils should be very narrow to block the light. Try getting your pupils dilated at the eye doctor in the middle of summer and then going outside. One thing to keep in mind is that not all lenses have the same aperture values. For instance many professional lenses, such as the Canon 70-200MM F/2.8 are wider than say some kit lenses that only open to F/5.6. This is what photographers mean when they say "fast lens". By the way, f/2.8 is the aperture value. The difference is the amount of light reaching the sensor. With a f/2.8 lens more light is getting to the sensor than with a 5.6 lens. Smaller number = more light. The primary reason I think most or at least why I, upgraded to a 2.8 Lens is the bokeh! Aperture also changes the depth of field in your images. If you were to position a subject in a room between your camera and the wall and focus on that subject, what is in front of and behind your subject will fall out of focus. With an aperture of 2.8 your subject (or probably the precise point where you focused) would be in focus, but everything behind that line or in front of that line would fall out. This is much more apparent at lower apertures such as f/2.8 than it would be at f/5.6. This blurring of the background is what we call bokeh. It adds a nice effect to portraits. It allows you to draw the viewer's eyes to the subject. We'll also want to focus on our subject's eyes because that is where we'll be drawing our viewer into!

## Summary

So in summary, you have 3 primary settings to worry about: Aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. Each setting plays a role in your exposure. Slow shutters speed may cause blur if you're not on a tripod and a wide open aperture (f/2.8) will help blur your background. ISO is usually the setting I set on location and change rarely on the location. Keep in a mind a large light change will require you to change this, no doubt, such as going outside or coming inside. Generally, I'll ask myself which settings I want and for what reasons, set my aperture and shutter where I want them, and use the ISO to get things exposed. If I find the ISO too high, I adjust as necessary.

## The real truth!

The best thing you can do right now is go get your camera and *PRACTICE!*	Take a few shots, change some settings, mess it all up, then come back and fix it. Then go outside and try to get a good exposure. Practice will make choosing your settings second nature, it just takes time.
