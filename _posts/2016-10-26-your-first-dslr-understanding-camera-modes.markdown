So you've just got your nice new DSLR or Mirror-less camera? Awesome. Now it's time to get out and take some pictures, but before you do that, lets talk about those modes!

Most modern cameras have several modes of operation. Generally there is Auto, Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority, Bulb, and Manual. We're not even going to talk about any of the "Creative Modes" as I think they're called. These are things like portrait mode and action mode (the little running man) in most cameras. I don't use these and I don't recommend them at all. We're also going to skip some of the modes seen on the more advanced cameras like the 5D Mark III which has creative programing mode.

## Auto

We'll start with Auto. Auto is exactly that, the camera controls everything. The camera will automatically calculate the exposure based on the available light. At first you might think this is great, but remember, a camera is a computer and computers are logical, not creative! So your camera will happily make that nice photo with the sun behind little Johnny 18% grey for you. Most likely the sky will be really bright and little Johnny's face will be cast into darkness. This is auto mode. You have no creative control over the camera's exposure at all.

## Shutter Priority

Shutter Priority is where you choose the shutter speed and the camera determines the rest. Very similar but this mode does give you some minor creative control. I find I'll only use this in very rare circumstances where things are changing crazy fast and I just want to ensure my photos aren't blurry. To be honest though, if I spend half as much time with my camera as I should, I would still be in manual.

## Aperture Priority

Aperture Priority is the exact opposite. You select the camera's aperture and the camera finds the shutter speed. Again this is ok in some instances but, still not a lot of control.

## Manual

Ah, finally: Manual! This is where we want to be. Here we are controlling both the shutter speed and the aperture ourselves and it is where we can get creative and ensure we get the best exposed shots. I'll warn you now, manual takes some practice. You'll need to take the time to commit it to Muscle memory. Switching to manual was the single most influential thing I did for my photography. I have photos from years ago where I shot in JPG(you are shooting RAW aren't you?) and on auto, if only I could go back.

## Bulb

Bulb I find I rarely use. Bulb allows you to manually control the shutter by holding down the button. You press the button, shutter opens, when you let go it closes. This mode is really only useful on a tripod and I think I've only ever used it for a few things like light painting or fireworks. This mode can make for a few hours of fun with your camera if you've got nothing else to do.

## Why Manual?

So we explained what all of the different modes are, but now you're wondering why I advocate for manual mode? The short story is control. We want to have as much control as possible in the exposure of our resulting image. The longer version is that your camera is nothing more than a computer. It can calculate and run all sorts of complex algorithms, but it can't think like you can. It does have a brain like we do. There is no "creative" juice in your camera. The creativity comes from you, the photographer, and by letter our camera control every aspect of our image, we're not being very creative. Along those lines, your camera doesn't actually know what a properly exposed image could be, your subject could be backlit. All it looks for is 18% grey and that is the target exposure for everything automated in the camera.

We'll get into more details about what shutter speed and aperture do and how to use them in my next post, for now, just get out and shoot!
