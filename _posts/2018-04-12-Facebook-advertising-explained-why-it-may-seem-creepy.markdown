The recent questions by congress show that some of our lawmakers just don’t understand technology and recent comments online say the same thing of users of the very platform.

With the recent questioning of practices by the CEO of Facebook, I’ve seen a lot of misinformation and frankly a lot of really bad understanding among its users and the public. The recent questions by congress show that some of our lawmakers just don’t understand technology and recent comments online say the same thing of users of the very platform.

First things first, let’s cover why you feel creeped out when on Facebook. The recent grilling of the CEO has left many users to begin complaining about how creepy Facebook has been and how Facebook is tracking their every move. To begin with, this isn’t the main reason he was brought to DC. It’s also only partially true that Facebook is tracking you. It’s also true that it can be good and bad technology.

## A history in advertising:

A quick history in advertising is relevant at the moment. In days gone by, if you were looking for a product or service, you’d generally go to the market. The market, meaning a central place where shops were setup to buy, sell, or barter goods. As time moved on we began seeing radio and video advertising designed to bring shoppers to the product. In today’s world we live without commercials. We change the channel when commercials come on the radio and with technologies like video on demand, we can fast forward through most commercials.
So in today’s world, marketing has brought on a whole new meaning. Changes in search algorithms have brought about changes before website marketing as well. All these changes mean that marketing are in a constant state of motion. Marketing no longer means a big billboard ad or a radio commercial. In fact, traditional advertising is largely considered less effective today than it has been in years past. We’re ingrained to tune these ads out.

## So where do business go to market to consumers?

This is where the internet comes into play and believe it or not, it can be great for small businesses. You see, when radio and television were the only real ad choices, it was expensive to start a business. Starting a business today still requires an investment of time and money but the investment in marketing is much different. Radio commercials and TV commercials are expensive, but driving users to your website from sites like Facebook are much more cost effective.

## How it works…

Facebook isn’t really tracking you like you think. As much as I wish I could say Facebook is paying me to say that, I can’t. Most users would think that seeing an ad on Facebook after going to Google and searching for XYZ solution means that Facebook put a cookie into your browser or has a tracker on your computer or a drone buzzing around outside your window. No not quite right.
What they do have is Facebook ads and the Facebook pixel. The Facebook Pixel is a piece of tracking code that goes on a business’s website. So for instance, my photography business installs this code on my website. Now if you visit my website this code fires and if you’re logged into Facebook it just records that you’ve been to my website.

Just because you’ve been to my website doesn’t guarantee you’ll see my ad though. I do that I simply setup an ad in Facebook using the pixel as my target audience. So now you’ve been to my website and then you go to Facebook and see my ad.

Why is this so important? You, the consumer have showed an interest in my product or service or that you have a problem that I can solve. Now I can tell Facebook to only send ads to people that have visited my website or a landing page I’ve setup for this purpose. This is called retargeting. Instead of flooding everybody with ads, I’m showing only the people who have shown interest in my product or service my ads, in the hopes that they’ll come back and buy my product. As a small business this is huge! I can save money and get much better leads than ever before. I know you’re a better lead because you’ve been to my website, so you’re obviously looking for what I’m offering.

## Still feel creeped out?

I get it, you still feel creeped out. It’s not normal but the truth is, this is how advertising today works. It’s great for small businesses that are able to learn about this technology and utilize it and it’s much more cost effective for those businesses. It’s still catching on to smaller businesses but it’s getting there.
Some other things we can do with this…
My business is very specific in its targeting. I don’t mean that we don’t want certain customers, I just mean that our business serves customers at a certain time in their life, mainly when they’re getting married through wedding photography or when they’re child is at a certain age such as in sweet 16 and quinceanera photography. In the old marketing world, I’d need to send this message out to market to these people but I’d be saying the same thing to everyone.
Imagine a bunch of people in a room, say 100 people. I’m up at the front and have something that can help you in the audience but you don’t know it. Now I get on a PA and start yelling that I can help you, but I don’t know who you are. I just know there is 1 person in this group that I can help, not very effective right? You hear me yelling along with 50 other people who can help other people in the room and nothing gets done.
Now, I’m up there and I see that you’re wearing a “needs help with X” on your shirt. I can now help you with X and I know that YOU are the person I can help!
With Facebook ads, I can target my ads to gender, age, marital status, basic interests, etc. Again this is huge for small businesses! The cost of this advertising is much cheaper than a radio commercial or TV ad and it’s targeted! It’s the difference between having a PA system and having someone’s cell phone number.

## What about privacy

Ah privacy. I am a big supporter of privacy. To be honest this pixel technology can be a little scary. I would equate it this way though. Imagine for a moment that you get in your car and go to a store. Do you have any expectation of privacy in the store? By law, except in the bathroom, no you don’t. You’re in public and have no reasonable expectation of privacy. In essence that is what you’re doing when you’re going to a website. When you visit my websites, you’re visiting my virtual storefront. Contrary to how some people perceive the internet, it’s not just a big cloud in the sky. My websites sits on a computer I pay for, similar to a building’s lease. So in effect you’re visiting my public store. I won’t get into the weeds about how this code is run but you get the idea.
Other forms of “tracking” It has been rumored for a long time that some phone apps actually listen to your conversations and use this data in a similar fashion to above. While I support the above technology, I wouldn’t support the active monitoring of phones via apps for the same purpose. There is a limit. Truthfully, I couldn’t tell you if it is true or not, I’d sure like to know. I’ll only say this, if you want to get an understanding of what a company can do, look at their terms of service agreement. It might be eye opening.

So while we’re all not exactly pleased with what Facebook has been in the news for, I hope you’ll understand that the technology being used in ads isn’t relevant to why he is being questioned. If you truly understand the technology we have available, you’ll understand, that it’s a good thing. It can feel a bit creepy but it’s a good thing for small businesses today. There are of course ways to block these attempts to track but keep in mind that you’re still going to see ads, they’ll just be about stuff you might not care about vs stuff you do care about. As for all the other issues surrounding the CEO, I’ll leave that one to someone else.

I hope this article has cleared up some of the concerns and fear that’s been flying around, rest assured that it’s not as evil as it might always sound and Facebook isn’t the only one doing it.
