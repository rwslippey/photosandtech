... The difference here is the uniting of technology and photography. Both are my passions. I am not what I would call a programmer but I have done programming. I hope this site inspires others to get into their passion and do something!


## Goals

* I hope to help photographers understand different technologies that may help them in their photography
* We'll talk about various cyber issues and new technologies that effect us as photographers
* We'll go over the true basics of photography... something I wish I would have done when I first started
* I really want to share my learning experiences and the mistakes I've made to help others.
* In some cases this will be a log of information for myself to remeber what I did and how (the geeks know what I'm talking about here)
