This page is really just going to be a running list of some of the gear of use and why I like it, maybe what alternative or cheaper gear is available. Just because.

## Each day always starts with COFFEE!

Coffee, I literally run on it but not in the sense you might think. I don't have a fancy single cup coffee maker or an expensive expresso machine. I've honestly found the coffee pot we're accustomed to to be very, well nasty. Coffee for me has been truly disgusting for years. It's always tasted burnt, bitter, or weak.

So many years ago I set out on an educational journey to figure out why my coffee always tastes like crap. The truth is most brewers don't get hot enough, don't control temperature well enough and pre-ground coffee is generally old.

To get started tasting really good coffee (without paying $3 a cup) first get whole bean coffee, preferablly from a local roastery or via mail order. I'll add links in the future to a few companies I order from.

You'll need a way to grind that coffee, for now I recommend starting with the grinder to the left. This grinder is a burr grinder. Don't confuse this with a spice grinder which uses blades. Blade griders are horrible for coffee. I'll get more in depth in that later on but this grinder is cheap enough that you can play around without spedning too much money.
